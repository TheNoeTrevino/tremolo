									Real Reading, Not Memorization
								</Typography>
								<Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2, lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
									When I was teaching, I always wished for a tool like this. An
									application that could be configured to repetitively practice
									tough patterns, both rhythmically and harmonically, while
									maintaining the element of genuine reading rather than
									memorization.
								</Typography>
								<Typography variant="body1" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
									Students often memorize difficult passages, but muscle memory
									fails under pressure. True sight-reading skills, however,
									remain strong even when nerves kick in. This application
									forces students to develop real reading skills by preventing
									memorization through dynamic, changing exercises.

									UIL-Focused Practice
								</Typography>
								<Typography variant="body1" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
									We constantly see the same rhythms appear in UIL sight reading
									rooms. Wouldn't it be great to dive into these specific
									patterns for preparation? Or practice simplified versions of
									difficult rhythms to guide students along a more logical
									learning path? What about applying notes over
									frequently-tested rhythms? Our goal is to address all these
									needs.
