|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| /mary       | 21.36    | 19.45    | 36.87    | 3.86        | 46.82             |

## Performance Comparison: FastAPI vs Django REST Framework

While direct DRF comparison was not performed in this test run, FastAPI demonstrates characteristics that typically outperform Django REST Framework:

### FastAPI Advantages Observed

1. **Low Latency**
   - Average response times: 15-21ms
   - Minimal overhead from async/await architecture
   - Direct route handling without Django middleware stack

2. **High Throughput**
   - 46-69 requests/second per endpoint
   - Efficient request handling with Uvicorn
   - No ORM overhead (stateless service)

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Stable memory across 100+ requests
   - Lightweight framework footprint
   - No Django app initialization overhead

4. **Consistent Performance**
   - Low standard deviation (0.62-3.79ms)
   - Predictable response times
   - Minimal P99 latency spikes

### Expected DRF Comparison

Based on typical benchmarks, FastAPI generally provides:
- **2-3x faster response times** vs DRF for simple JSON endpoints
- **Lower memory usage** (no Django runtime)
- **Better async support** (native async/await)
- **Faster startup time** (no migration/admin overhead)

## Test Execution

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
# Method 1: Using pytest
cd /Users/noetrevino/projects/tremolo/feature/backend/music/music2
source env/bin/activate
pytest tests/test_performance_comparison.py -v -s -m performance --no-cov

# Method 2: Using standalone script
python3 tests/performance_report.py

# Method 3: Using benchmark script (requires server running)
bash benchmark.sh
```

### Test Markers

All performance tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.performance` for easy filtering:

```bash
# Run only performance tests
pytest -m performance

# Exclude performance tests from regular runs
pytest -m "not performance"
```

---

## Conclusions

### All Performance Targets Met ✅

1. ✅ **Response times < 500ms** - Actual: 15-24ms (20-30x better)
2. ✅ **Throughput > 10 req/s** - Actual: 46-69 req/s (5-7x better)
3. ✅ **Zero failed requests** - 100% success rate across all tests
4. ✅ **Memory stable** - No growth over 100+ requests

### FastAPI Performance Summary

The FastAPI implementation demonstrates excellent performance characteristics:

- **Ultra-low latency:** Average 15-21ms response times
- **High throughput:** 46-69 requests/second sustained
- **High reliability:** 100% success rate under load
- **Memory efficient:** Stable usage across extended operations
- **Predictable:** Low variance in response times (σ < 4ms)

### Recommendations

1. **Production Ready:** Performance metrics indicate the service is production-ready
2. **Scalability:** Current performance supports horizontal scaling
3. **Monitoring:** Consider adding Prometheus/Grafana for production metrics
4. **Load Testing:** Future work could include concurrent request testing (e.g., with locust)
5. **Baseline Established:** These metrics serve as performance regression baseline
